*My research interests and interests in general*
include many areas of Applied and Theoretical Mathematics:

- Mathematical and computational modeling
- Numerical and computational simulation
- Scientific programming
- Computational science
- Analysis and design of algorithms
- Linear Algebra
- Mathematical Analysis
- Fractals
- Formal logic
- Education
- Mathematical art and divulgation of science
- Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning
- Graph theory

I work almost exclusively with open-source software, such as SageMath,
Scilab, Octave, Python, etc., and I am an advocate of the Open Science
movement.
